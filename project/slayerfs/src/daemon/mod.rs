//! Daemon and background worker orchestration
//!
//! Responsibilities:
//! - Run the main event loop for background workers: upload pools, compaction,
//!   garbage collection, and session cleanup.
//! - Provide lifecycle management for the long-running daemon process and
//!   supervise worker tasks.
//! - Expose a CLI-friendly daemon mode that can be started from the `mount`
//!   command or systemd service.
//!
//! Important notes / TODOs:
//! - Add graceful shutdown handling and signal handling for POSIX systems.
//! - Wire worker metrics and backpressure mechanisms.
//!
//! Submodules:
//! - `worker`: background worker implementations (upload, gc, compaction)
//! - `supervisor`: supervisor utilities for managing worker lifecycles
pub mod worker;
pub mod supervisor;

// Module implementation TODOs remain.
