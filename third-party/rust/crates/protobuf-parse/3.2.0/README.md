# Parse `.proto` files

Parse `.proto` file definitions, **not** the protobuf text format serialization.

Files can be parsed using pure Rust parser (mod `pure`)
or using the `protoc` command (mod `protoc`).

This crate is not meant to be used directly, but rather through the `protobuf-codegen` crate.
If you think this crate might be useful to you,
please [consider creating an issue](https://github.com/stepancheg/rust-protobuf/issues/new),
until that this crate is considered to have **no stable API**.
