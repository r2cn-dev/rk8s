/// <p>Specifies encryption-related information for an Amazon S3 bucket that is a destination for replicated objects.</p><note>
/// <p>If you're specifying a customer managed KMS key, we recommend using a fully qualified KMS key ARN. If you use a KMS key alias instead, then KMS resolves the key within the requesterâ€™s account. This behavior can result in data that's encrypted with a KMS key that belongs to the requester, and not the bucket owner.</p>
